# Convert to BlueJ
A Ruby project to convert Eclipse and IntelliJ (not implemented) projects into BlueJ projects

### Backstory  
My Computer Science teacher loves BlueJ so to get around having to use BlueJ I created this so that I could still program in other IDEs  
  
### Usage
`ruby convert.rb SOURCE_PROJECT OUTPUT_PROJECT [options]`  
`-cIDE`, `--convert=IDE` - Specify what IDE the source project was from  
  
`OUTPUT_PROJECT` cannot already be a folder
